#Below is a description of R markdown described by R studio.
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

#R code chunk number 1

#Step 1: load library or dataset
summary(mtcars)
library(ggplot2)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{}


#Step 2: Create a simple plot

myplot <- ggplot(mtcars, (aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
      geom_point() +
      labs(title = "MPG vs HP",
      x = "Miles per hour",
      y = "horsepower"))


myplot

```


## Latex Math

```{}

#R code #2: LaTeX math

# LaTeX Math Examples

#Inline math looks like this:  
#The relationship $a + b = c$ holds for many algebraic systems.

#Displayed equations appear centered:

#$$
#\alpha^2 + \beta^2 = \gamma^2
#$$


```

## Reflections

```{}
#Here is my reflection

#Using R Markdown feels very different from writing a normal report because the code, text, and math parts are all in one document.
#The way its ran is also different. you have to run only the code chunks, and to compile it you press knit. 
#Some things that I liked and dislike is that I keep forgetting to put ```, my latex wasnt working so I commented it out, and that it was fairly easy to understand errors when running my document while also being easy for me to generate plots.
